### Jerry's Website

This is my personal website, where I showcase my portfolio, share my thoughts, and provide information about myself. I also plan to use this as a learning tool for new technologies!

Technologies Used: TypeScript, React, CSS, Sass, HTML

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Running

To run the project locally, use: `npm start`. Note that if any changes are made to the .sass files, they will have to be complied into .css files. Using `sass --watch <sass file> <css file>` will automatically watch a specified sass file for changes and recomplie it into the specified css file. Ensure that all packages are installed with `npm i`.

To deploy to GitHub pages, run `npm run deploy`.
